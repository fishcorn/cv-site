Kernel learning is the problem of determining the best kernel (either from a dictionary of fixed kernels, or from a smooth space of kernel representations) for a given task.
In this paper, we describe a new approach to kernel learning that establishes connections between the Fourier-analytic representation of kernels arising out of Bochner\'s theorem and a specific kind of feed-forward network using cosine activations.
We analyze the complexity of this space of hypotheses and demonstrate empirically that our approach provides scalable kernel learning superior in quality to prior approaches.
