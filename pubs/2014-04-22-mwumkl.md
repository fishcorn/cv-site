We present a geometric formulation of the Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) problem.
To do so, we reinterpret the problem of learning kernel weights as searching for a kernel that maximizes the minimum (kernel) distance between two convex polytopes.
This interpretation combined with additional structural insights from our geometric formulation allows us to reduce the MKL problem to a simple optimization routine that yields provable convergence as well as quality guarantees.
As a result our method scales efficiently to much larger data sets than most prior methods can handle.
Empirical evaluation on eleven datasets shows that we are significantly faster and even compare favorably with an uniform unweighted combination of kernels.
