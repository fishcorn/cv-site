I graduated with my PhD in Computing from the
[University of Utah School of Computing](http://www.cs.utah.edu/), and my advisor was
[Suresh Venkatasubramanian](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~suresh/). 
My specialties are in machine learning and algorithms. I am no longer on the
market! I joined [Kitware](http://www.kitware.com/) in Fall of 2016.
